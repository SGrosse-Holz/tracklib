Bayesian Inference of Loop Dynamics (BILD)

This module provides the implementation of BILD, proposed by `Gabriele,
Brand√£o, Grosse-Holz, et al.
<biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.12.472242v1>`. Since the ideas behind this
scheme are explained in the paper (and its supplementary information), in the
code we only provide technical documentation, assuming knowledge of the
reference text.
